        <h3>Scientific Career</h3>
        <p> Augusto Primo Di Diomede held the position of a professor at the University of Rome, teaching a variety of subjects related to his expertise. He also collaborated with prestigious national and international research institutions, including the National Research Council (CNR), the National Prehistoric Ethnographic Museum "Luigi Pigorini", the National Archaeological Museum of Athens, the British Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution.
 He not only served as a professor but also acted as a co-advisor for the natural sciences thesis of Angela Albero, a young student who would later achieve great fame as a paleontologist. Additionally, he led numerous archaeological and research expeditions in various parts of the world, including:
 <ul>
  <li>Explored the presence of mysterious Greek and Roman cults in Anatolia and Turkey, revealing numerous archaeological sites and artifacts of invaluable historical and religious significance.</li>
  <li>Investigated the Greek and Roman colonization of the Sahara Desert, tracing ancient cities and temples along the trade routes between Africa and the Mediterranean.</li>
  <li>Made significant discoveries regarding rituals dedicated to Hecate, the goddess of magic, in the Acropolis of Athens, identifying the location where animal sacrifices, spells, and invocations took place.</li>
  <li>Acted as an archaeological consultant for a study on gender culture in ancient Egypt, analyzing artistic, literary, and religious evidence that unveiled different conceptions of femininity and masculinity in Egyptian society.</li>
<li>Syncretic Religion Hecate-Isis: Augusto is known for documenting the earliest presumed example of syncretic religion between Hecate and Isis, a fusion of the Greco-Roman cult of Hecate and the Egyptian cult of Isis. According to his hypothesis, this religion spread among merchants and travelers crossing the Sahara Desert, giving rise to a network of followers and temples dedicated to both goddesses. Augusto published the results of his research in a book titled "Hecate-Isis: A Syncretic Religion between Greece, Rome, and Egypt".</li>
<li>Discovery of the Temple of Hecate: He discovered the first temple dedicated to Hecate, the goddess of magic, on the Acropolis of Athens, hidden beneath a more recent structure. This temple was adorned with symbols and images that evoked the attributes and functions of the goddess, such as the moon, dogs, serpents, torches, and keys. The temple also housed an underground altar where secret rituals in honor of Hecate were conducted.</li>
<li>Greek Temple in the Desert: His research led to the discovery of the first Greek temple in the Sahara Desert, evidence of Greek cultural influence in what appeared to be a remote and inhospitable region. This temple was dedicated to Hecate-Isis, a syncretic form of the Greek and Egyptian deity of magic. It was located in an oasis, along with a sacred spring and an oracle.</li>
