           <h3>History</h3> 
            <p>
				The cult of the "Sons of Wotan" is based on a reinterpretation of Norse mythology and the figure of Wotan, the supreme god in the Germanic tradition, also known as Odin in Norse mythology. Wotan is considered a warrior god, the lord of animals, the god of wisdom, magic, and poetry. This cult seeks to rediscover and relive ancient Norse traditions and myths, with a particular focus on Wotan's qualities as a fierce warrior, charismatic leader, and visionary.
				A significant aspect of this practice is the interest in the folkloric tradition of the berserkers, Norse warriors known for their state of "berserk fury" in battle, during which they seemed to be possessed by a supernatural force. Devotees may seek to emulate these warrior aspects in their spirituality, undergoing initiation, purification, and trance rituals. Some may even wear animal skins or masks, such as bears or wolves, to symbolize their connection to Wotan and nature.
				The cult of the "Sons of Wotan" distinguishes itself from other forms of Germanic neopaganism, such as Ásatrú or Odinism, by its emphasis on ethnic belonging and white racial supremacy. Some of its members have been involved in criminal activities, such as white supremacist groups.

               <h3>Beliefs and Structure</h3>
				<p> 
					The cult of the "Sons of Wotan" is based on a cosmic and cyclical worldview in which the fate of humans is intertwined with that of the gods. The gods are seen as archetypal forces that act in nature and in humans and can be contacted through prayer, sacrifice, and meditation. Among the gods, Wotan holds a central place as both a father and creator god and a god of destruction and regeneration. Wotan is associated with the concept of Wyrd, fate understood as the cosmic law that governs all existence.
					Followers of the cult believe that the white race is the direct descendant of the gods and has the duty to preserve its genetic and cultural heritage from any form of contamination or degeneration. They view Christianity as an alien and hostile religion imposed through violence on Germanic peoples, leading to the loss of their original identity and spirituality. They also oppose multiculturalism, globalism, materialism, and any form of equality or tolerance toward other races or religions. They draw inspiration from the warlike, virile, and elitist values of Viking society and aspire to a simple, natural, and self-sufficient way of life.
					The cult of the "Sons of Wotan" lacks a centralized or hierarchical organizational structure and is based on a network of autonomous and individual groups that share common beliefs and practices. These groups can be called "kindreds," "clans," "tribes," or "families" and are composed of people bound by blood, friendship, or spiritual affinity. The groups periodically gather to celebrate pagan rituals, festivals, and rites of passage following the cycles of nature and seasons. Rituals may include reciting prayers, reading sacred texts, singing hymns, offering gifts to the gods, consuming alcoholic beverages, practicing runic magic or seiðr, and participating in physical games or challenges.

				<p>
					The cult of the "Sons of Wotan" lacks a centralized or hierarchical organizational structure and is based on a network of autonomous and individual groups that share common beliefs and practices.
					These groups can be called "kindreds," "clans," "tribes," or "families" and are composed of people bound by blood, friendship, or spiritual affinity. The groups periodically gather to celebrate pagan rituals, festivals, and rites of passage following the cycles of nature and seasons. Rituals may include reciting prayers, reading sacred texts, singing hymns, offering gifts to the gods, consuming alcoholic beverages, practicing runic magic or seiðr, and participating in physical games or challenges.
					Each group has a degree of autonomy in defining its own rules and operational methods, but there are common principles that guide the actions of Wotanists. These include respect for ancestors, gods, and nature; loyalty to their group and race; personal and collective honor; courage and determination; the pursuit of wisdom and knowledge; the defense of their land and rights; resistance against enemies and corruption; and a willingness to sacrifice for a higher cause.
					Wotanists do not have an authoritative or priestly figure to represent or lead them but rely on consensus and cooperation among group members. However, some individuals may assume a reference or leadership role based on their abilities, charisma, or spiritual experience. These individuals may be called "goðar" (singular "goði"), a term that means "priest" or "guide" in ancient Norse language. Goðar are responsible for leading rituals, teaching traditions, resolving disputes, and coordinating the group's activities. These groups ultimately report to an authority called Huginn (the name of Odin's raven), which maintains contact between groups and acts as a mediator in disputes between various groups where an individual goði might be biased.

        <h3>Controversies</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The cult has gained some following among far-right and white supremacist movements, both in the United States and Europe, who have been accused of adopting Wotanist symbols and rituals to express their ethnic identity and rejection of Christianity and multiculturalism. This has led to the cult being associated with extremism and white supremacy.</li>
		<li>In some investigations, certain "Sons of Wotan" groups have been accused of carrying out human sacrifices.</li>
